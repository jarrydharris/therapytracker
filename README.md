# Speech and Language Therapy Tracker

This is a data collection and visulation app designed to be used by Speech and Language pathologists during intervention therapy.

## Getting Started

1. Go to https://jharr.shinyapps.io/therapytracker/
2. Under the home tab create a new client or use the existing testdata.csv file provided to explore the app
3. Once a client has been loaded, click session in the sidebar
4. Enter a new activity or choose a preloaded one from the "Activity Name" select input field
5. Choose alpha if the child correctly responds to the interaction, beta if not (these symbols have been chosen so the child does not register positive or negative feedback from use of the app)
6. After the session is done, click results to explore the outcomes. The "Session results" enables you to choose a specific date and drill down on the activities, "All results" allows you to compare them over time.
7. Click the data tab to edit or save the results.
8. To start a new session please close and reopen the tab (A reset button will be added later to make this a nicer process)
